# Microsoft Governance
Microsoft Governance for Architecting Collaboration Experiences - Good

## Key Issues off the bat
* Get Membership right
* Get Identity right
* Support people on whatever device they are using
* Different types of governance for different levels of people in your organisation
* Hybrid is here to stay - some organisations are asking people back to the office but many are not
* One size fits all doesn't work - have different policies for different types of experiences in the 365
* Happy people and good adoption if you automate as much as possible

## Phases
* First make sure M365 Group Governance in order - (even if you just focus on the way you name your 365 groups and how they show up in the list, then departments, and divisons then organisation)
* Have people to enrol their Devices (ensure access governance has frictionless MFA and implement conditional access policies)
* Have health Devices then Evolve to Zero Trust

## Top 5 Points to Reinforce:

1. Governance is More than Monitoring:

Data governance is not just about reviewing access logs but about creating policies to ensure proper data handling across the entire lifecycle, from creation to deletion.
Balance Between Control and Usability: Locking down too much will hinder productivity. Governance should enable secure collaboration without making it difficult for users to get their jobs done.
Phased Approach: Start small and scale up. Rolling out in phases helps identify issues early and fine-tune governance before a full deployment.
User-Centric Policies: Governance needs to be built around how users collaborate. Understand their requirements and tailor policies to support business processes while maintaining security.

3. Training and Communication:

Implementing policies without proper training will lead to workarounds. Embed governance into daily tools and provide ongoing training.

4. How to Start:

Begin by understanding the business goals and how data is used within the organization. Identify key stakeholders and start with a pilot program to experiment with governance policies. Ensure you balance security, compliance, and business needs. Develop initial policies for areas such as data sharing, naming conventions, and guest access.

## 4-Hour Workshop Structure:

A 4-hour workshop could be structured as follows:

Hour 1: Introduction to Data Governance
* Overview of governance principles (balancing risk vs. usability, stages of implementation).
* Key stakeholders and their roles.

Hour 2: Defining Governance Requirements
* Explore business goals and collaboration needs.
* Identify sensitive data and compliance requirements.

Hour 3: Policy Design and Best Practices
Discuss governance best practices: site creation, team naming conventions, and access controls.
Introduce specific Microsoft 365 governance tools like sensitivity labels and guest access controls.

Hour 4: Phased Implementation and Next Steps
* Plan a phased rollout.
* Establish a feedback mechanism.
* Define training and support needed to maintain compliance.
