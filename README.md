# Microsoft Governance
Microsoft Governance for Architecting Collaboration Experiences - Good

## Key Issues off the bat
* Get Membership right
* Get Identity right
* Support people on whatever device they are using
* Different types of governance for different levels of people in your organisation
* Hybrid is here to stay - some organisations are asking people back to the office but many are not
* One size fits all doesn't work - have different policies for different types of experiences in the 365
* Happy people and good adoption if you automate as much as possible
* Working cross tenant to improve tenant to tenant organisations (shared channels).

## Phases
* First make sure M365 Group Governance in order - (even if you just focus on the way you name your 365 groups and how they show up in the list, then departments, and divisons then organisation)
* Have people to enrol their Devices (ensure access governance has frictionless MFA and implement conditional access policies and continuous access evaluation)
* Have health Devices then Evolve to Zero Trust

## Top 5 Points to Reinforce:

1. Governance is More than Monitoring:

Data governance is not just about reviewing access logs but about creating policies to ensure proper data handling across the entire lifecycle, from creation to deletion.

**Data Governance is Proactive, Not Just Reactive: It's about defining policies, roles, and processes before problems arise, not just reacting to data breaches or misuse.**

2. Balance Between Control and Usability: Locking down too much will hinder productivity. Governance should enable secure collaboration without making it difficult for users to get their jobs done.

3. Phased Approach: Start small and scale up. Rolling out in phases helps identify issues early and fine-tune governance before a full deployment.

4. User-Centric Policies: Governance needs to be built around how users collaborate. Understand their requirements and tailor policies to support business processes while maintaining security.

**It's About Business Value, Not Just Compliance: Data governance helps organizations derive value from their data, improve decision-making, and foster innovation.**

5. Training and Communication:

Implementing policies without proper training will lead to workarounds. Embed governance into daily tools and provide ongoing training.

**People are Key: Technology is important, but data governance success hinges on clear communication, collaboration, and accountability across the organization.**

4. How to Start:

Begin by understanding the business goals and how data is used within the organization. Identify key stakeholders and start with a pilot program to experiment with governance policies. Ensure you balance security, compliance, and business needs. Develop initial policies for areas such as data sharing, naming conventions, and guest access.

## 4-Hour Workshop Structure:

A 4-hour workshop could be structured as follows:

Hour 1: Introduction to Data Governance
* Overview of governance principles (balancing risk vs. usability, stages of implementation).
* Key stakeholders and their roles.

Hour 2: Defining Governance Requirements
* Explore business goals and collaboration needs.
* Identify sensitive data and compliance requirements.

Hour 3: Policy Design and Best Practices
Discuss governance best practices: site creation, team naming conventions, and access controls.
Introduce specific Microsoft 365 governance tools like sensitivity labels and guest access controls.

Hour 4: Phased Implementation and Next Steps
* Plan a phased rollout.
* Establish a feedback mechanism.
* Define training and support needed to maintain compliance.
